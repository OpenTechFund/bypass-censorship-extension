# Collateral Freedom
Extension for Chrome and Chromium

This extension has been developped by [Brendan Abolivier](https://github.com/babolivier) and [Clément Salaün](https://github.com/altitude)
during the **Collateral Freedom** hackaton organised by [Reporters Without Borders](https://en.rsf.org/) and [An Daol Vras](http://lacantine-brest.net/).

Its goal is to ease the access to the **Collateral Freedom** initiative, which replicates websites around the Web in order to make them available
for everyone, including in the contries they're censored in.

## Howto

The extension will add an icon next to your address bar. Most of the time, this icon will stay unchanged, and clicking it will show
a message saying that no replication of the current tab's website has been set up by RWB.

When connecting (or trying to connect) to a website for which a replicated version has been set up by RWB, the extension's icon will turn
red. Clicking on them will open a pop-up page with a button.

If you click the button, it will bring you to the replicated website.
