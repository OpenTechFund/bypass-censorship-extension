# Bypass Censorship Extension

Cross-browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that suggests available mirrors for sites that may be censored. This extension and its list of mirrors is curated by [BypassCensorship.org](https://bypasscensorship.org).

This extension is a fork of the [RSF Censorship Detector](https://git.abolivier.bzh/babolivier/rsf-censorship-detector) extension developped by [Brendan Abolivier](https://github.com/babolivier) and [Clément Salaün](https://github.com/altitude) during the **Collateral Freedom** hackaton organised by [Reporters Without Borders](https://en.rsf.org/) and [An Daol Vras](http://lacantine-brest.net/). To learn more about RSF's **Collateral Freedom** initiative, visit their site [here](https://rsf.org/collateral-freedom).

## Usage

The extension will add an icon next to your address bar. Most of the time, this icon will stay unchanged, and clicking it will show
a message saying that no replication of the current tab's website has been set up by [BypassCensorship.org](https://bypasscensorship.org).

When connecting (or trying to connect) to a website for which a replicated version has been set up by [BypassCensorship.org](https://bypasscensorship.org), the extension's icon will turn
red. Clicking it will open a pop-up page with a button.

If you click the button, it will bring you to the replicated website.
